# Design of Pac-Man Strategies with Embedded Markov Decision Process in a Dynamic, Non-Deterministic, Fully Observable Environment

### Abstract
This project designs Pac-Man strategies, whose decision-making protocol is solely based on Markov Decision Process, without the support of pathfinding algorithms nor heuristic functions, in a dynamic, non-deterministic, fully observable environment. This project provides the rare opportunity to refine the understanding of, and practice the application of Markov Decision Process in a classic arcade game setting. After significant number of hours of parameter tuning, my design achieved a win rate ranging between 50\% and 60\%. With the proven effectiveness of embedded Markov Decision Process, a spin-off Pac-Man AI project that incorporates the advantages of pathfinding algorithms, heuristic functions, and Markov Decision Process shall be on the agenda.
